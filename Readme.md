Confusion:

1.Operator and Constants pushed into SymbolTable means we cant push them again.Is it convenient ? i think so but wdyt. Is pushing operator convenient?

2.should we print tokens in token file even if the symbol is already pushed previously and we didnt push it in this step.

TODO :
unrecognized char error ?
